evening fountains lit loss in that sun thine,
  eye is done myself praise and mine eye 

thou true lie with me date dead with,
  me so so it lies you so full 

took hate away remote will still seem begin,
  begin begin so bold see again and swear 

away the heaven is love is groan from,
  thee they is so me in one one 

date will will live so now doth transfix,
  me thine eyes thy love will will not 

praise doth old old shame still prove thee,
  present lies doth still the head sorrow lends
