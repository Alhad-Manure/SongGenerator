From fairest creatures we desire increase	1	1
That thereby beauty's rose might never die	1	2
But as the riper should by time decease	1	3
His tender heir might bear his memory	1	4
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes	1	5
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel	1	6
Making a famine where abundance lies	1	7
Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel	1	8
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament	1	9
And only herald to the gaudy spring	1	10
Within thine own bud buriest thy content	1	11
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding	1	12
Pity the world or else this glutton be	1	13
To eat the world's due by the grave and thee	1	14
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow	2	1
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field	2	2
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now	2	3
Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held	2	4
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies	2	5
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days	2	6
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes	2	7
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise	2	8
How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use	2	9
If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine	2	10
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse	2	11
Proving his beauty by succession thine	2	12
This were to be new made when thou art old	2	13
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold	2	14
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest	3	1
Now is the time that face should form another	3	2
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest	3	3
Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother	3	4
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb	3	5
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry	3	6
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb	3	7
Of his self-love to stop posterity	3	8
Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee	3	9
Calls back the lovely April of her prime	3	10
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see	3	11
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time	3	12
But if thou live remember'd not to be	3	13
Die single and thine image dies with thee	3	14
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend	4	1
Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy	4	2
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend	4	3
And being frank she lends to those are free	4	4
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse	4	5
The bounteous largess given thee to give	4	6
Profitless usurer why dost thou use	4	7
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live	4	8
For having traffic with thy self alone	4	9
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive	4	10
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone	4	11
What acceptable audit canst thou leave	4	12
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee	4	13
Which used lives th executor to be	4	14
Those hours that with gentle work did frame	5	1
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell	5	2
Will play the tyrants to the very same	5	3
And that unfair which fairly doth excel	5	4
For never-resting time leads summer on	5	5
To hideous winter and confounds him there	5	6
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone	5	7
Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where	5	8
Then were not summer's distillation left	5	9
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass	5	10
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft	5	11
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was	5	12
But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet	5	13
Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet	5	14
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface	6	1
In thee thy summer ere thou be distill'd	6	2
Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place	6	3
With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd	6	4
That use is not forbidden usury	6	5
Which happies those that pay the willing loan	6	6
That's for thy self to breed another thee	6	7
Or ten times happier be it ten for one	6	8
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art	6	9
If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee	6	10
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart	6	11
Leaving thee living in posterity	6	12
Be not self-will'd for thou art much too fair	6	13
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir	6	14
Lo in the orient when the gracious light	7	1
Lifts up his burning head each under eye	7	2
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight	7	3
Serving with looks his sacred majesty	7	4
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill	7	5
Resembling strong youth in his middle age	7	6
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still	7	7
Attending on his golden pilgrimage	7	8
But when from highmost pitch with weary car	7	9
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day	7	10
The eyes fore duteous now converted are	7	11
From his low tract and look another way	7	12
So thou thyself outgoing in thy noon	7	13
Unlook'd on diest unless thou get a son	7	14
Music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly	8	1
Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy	8	2
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly	8	3
Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy	8	4
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds	8	5
By unions married do offend thine ear	8	6
They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds	8	7
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear	8	8
Mark how one string sweet husband to another	8	9
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering	8	10
Resembling sire and child and happy mother	8	11
Who all in one one pleasing note do sing	8	12
Whose speechless song being many seeming one	8	13
Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none	8	14
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye	9	1
That thou consum'st thy self in single life	9	2
Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die	9	3
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife	9	4
The world will be thy widow and still weep	9	5
That thou no form of thee hast left behind	9	6
When every private widow well may keep	9	7
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind	9	8
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend	9	9
Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it	9	10
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end	9	11
And kept unused the user so destroys it	9	12
No love toward others in that bosom sits	9	13
That on himself such murd'rous shame commits	9	14
For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any	10	1
Who for thy self art so unprovident	10	2
Grant if thou wilt thou art belov'd of many	10	3
But that thou none lov'st is most evident	10	4
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate	10	5
That gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire	10	6
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate	10	7
Which to repair should be thy chief desire	10	8
O change thy thought that I may change my mind	10	9
Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love	10	10
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind	10	11
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove	10	12
Make thee another self for love of me	10	13
That beauty still may live in thine or thee	10	14
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st	11	1
In one of thine from that which thou departest	11	2
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st	11	3
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest	11	4
Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase	11	5
Without this folly age and cold decay	11	6
If all were minded so the times should cease	11	7
And threescore year would make the world away	11	8
Let those whom nature hath not made for store	11	9
Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish	11	10
Look whom she best endow'd she gave thee more	11	11
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish	11	12
She carv'd thee for her seal and meant thereby	11	13
Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die	11	14
When I do count the clock that tells the time	12	1
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night	12	2
When I behold the violet past prime	12	3
And sable curls all silvered o'er with white	12	4
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves	12	5
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd	12	6
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves	12	7
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard	12	8
Then of thy beauty do I question make	12	9
That thou among the wastes of time must go	12	10
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake	12	11
And die as fast as they see others grow	12	12
And nothing gainst Time's scythe can make defence	12	13
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence	12	14
O that you were your self but love you are	13	1
No longer yours than you your self here live	13	2
Against this coming end you should prepare	13	3
And your sweet semblance to some other give	13	4
So should that beauty which you hold in lease	13	5
Find no determination then you were	13	6
Yourself again after yourself's decease	13	7
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear	13	8
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay	13	9
Which husbandry in honour might uphold	13	10
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day	13	11
And barren rage of death's eternal cold	13	12
O none but unthrifts Dear my love you know	13	13
You had a father let your son say so	13	14
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck	14	1
And yet methinks I have astronomy	14	2
But not to tell of good or evil luck	14	3
Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality	14	4
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell	14	5
Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind	14	6
Or say with princes if it shall go well	14	7
By oft predict that I in heaven find	14	8
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive	14	9
And constant stars in them I read such art	14	10
As Truth and beauty shall together thrive	14	11
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert	14	12
Or else of thee this I prognosticate	14	13
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date	14	14
When I consider every thing that grows	15	1
Holds in perfection but a little moment	15	2
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows	15	3
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment	15	4
When I perceive that men as plants increase	15	5
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky	15	6
Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease	15	7
And wear their brave state out of memory	15	8
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay	15	9
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight	15	10
Where wasteful Time debateth with decay	15	11
To change your day of youth to sullied night	15	12
And all in war with Time for love of you	15	13
As he takes from you I engraft you new	15	14
But wherefore do not you a mightier way	16	1
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time	16	2
And fortify your self in your decay	16	3
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme	16	4
Now stand you on the top of happy hours	16	5
And many maiden gardens yet unset	16	6
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers	16	7
Much liker than your painted counterfeit	16	8
So should the lines of life that life repair	16	9
Which this Time's pencil or my pupil pen	16	10
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair	16	11
Can make you live your self in eyes of men	16	12
To give away yourself keeps yourself still	16	13
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill	16	14
Who will believe my verse in time to come	17	1
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts	17	2
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb	17	3
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts	17	4
If I could write the beauty of your eyes	17	5
And in fresh numbers number all your graces	17	6
The age to come would say This poet lies	17	7
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces	17	8
So should my papers yellow'd with their age	17	9
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue	17	10
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage	17	11
And stretched metre of an antique song	17	12
But were some child of yours alive that time	17	13
You should live twice,--in it and in my rhyme	17	14
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day	18	1
Thou art more lovely and more temperate	18	2
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May	18	3
And summer's lease hath all too short a date	18	4
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines	18	5
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd	18	6
And every fair from fair sometime declines	18	7
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd	18	8
But thy eternal summer shall not fade	18	9
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st	18	10
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade	18	11
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st	18	12
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see	18	13
So long lives this and this gives life to thee	18	14
Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws	19	1
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood	19	2
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws	19	3
And burn the long-liv'd phoenix in her blood	19	4
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets	19	5
And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time	19	6
To the wide world and all her fading sweets	19	7
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime	19	8
O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow	19	9
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen	19	10
Him in thy course untainted do allow	19	11
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men	19	12
Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong	19	13
My love shall in my verse ever live young	19	14
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted	20	1
Hast thou the master mistress of my passion	20	2
A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted	20	3
With shifting change as is false women's fashion	20	4
An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling	20	5
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth	20	6
A man in hue all hues in his controlling	20	7
Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth	20	8
And for a woman wert thou first created	20	9
Till Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting	20	10
And by addition me of thee defeated	20	11
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing	20	12
But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure	20	13
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure	20	14
So is it not with me as with that Muse	21	1
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse	21	2
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use	21	3
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse	21	4
Making a couplement of proud compare	21	5
With sun and moon with earth and sea's rich gems	21	6
With April's first-born flowers and all things rare	21	7
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems	21	8
O let me true in love but truly write	21	9
And then believe me my love is as fair	21	10
As any mother's child though not so bright	21	11
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air	21	12
Let them say more that like of hearsay well	21	13
I will not praise that purpose not to sell	21	14
My glass shall not persuade me I am old	22	1
So long as youth and thou are of one date	22	2
But when in thee time's furrows I behold	22	3
Then look I death my days should expiate	22	4
For all that beauty that doth cover thee	22	5
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart	22	6
Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me	22	7
How can I then be elder than thou art	22	8
O therefore love be of thyself so wary	22	9
As I not for myself but for thee will	22	10
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary	22	11
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill	22	12
Presume not on th;heart when mine is slain	22	13
Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again	22	14
As an unperfect actor on the stage	23	1
Who with his fear is put beside his part	23	2
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage	23	3
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart	23	4
So I for fear of trust forget to say	23	5
The perfect ceremony of love's rite	23	6
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay	23	7
O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might	23	8
O let my looks be then the eloquence	23	9
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast	23	10
Who plead for love and look for recompense	23	11
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd	23	12
O learn to read what silent love hath writ	23	13
To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit	23	14
Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd	24	1
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart	24	2
My body is the frame wherein tis held	24	3
And perspective it is best painter's art	24	4
For through the painter must you see his skill	24	5
To find where your true image pictur'd lies	24	6
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still	24	7
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes	24	8
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done	24	9
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me	24	10
Are windows to my breast where-through the sun	24	11
Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee	24	12
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art	24	13
They draw but what they see know not the heart	24	14
Let those who are in favour with their stars	25	1
Of public honour and proud titles boast	25	2
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars	25	3
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most	25	4
Great princes favourites their fair leaves spread	25	5
But as the marigold at the sun's eye	25	6
And in themselves their pride lies buried	25	7
For at a frown they in their glory die	25	8
The painful warrior famoused for fight	25	9
After a thousand victories once foil'd	25	10
Is from the book of honour razed quite	25	11
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd	25	12
Then happy I that love and am belov'd	25	13
Where I may not remove nor be remov'd	25	14
Lord of my love to whom in vassalage	26	1
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit	26	2
To thee I send this written embassage	26	3
To witness duty not to show my wit	26	4
Duty so great which wit so poor as mine	26	5
May make seem bare in wanting words to show it	26	6
But that I hope some good conceit of thine	26	7
In thy soul's thought all naked will bestow it	26	8
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving	26	9
Points on me graciously with fair aspect	26	10
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving	26	11
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect	26	12
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee	26	13
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me	26	14
Weary with toil I haste me to my bed	27	1
The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd	27	2
But then begins a journey in my head	27	3
To work my mind when body's work's expired	27	4
For then my thoughts--from far where I abide	27	5
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee	27	6
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide	27	7
Looking on darkness which the blind do see	27	8
Save that my soul's imaginary sight	27	9
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view	27	10
Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night	27	11
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new	27	12
Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind	27	13
For thee and for myself no quiet find	27	14
How can I then return in happy plight	28	1
That am debarre'd the benefit of rest	28	2
When day's oppression is not eas'd by night	28	3
But day by night and night by day oppress'd	28	4
And each though enemies to either's reign	28	5
Do in consent shake hands to torture me	28	6
The one by toil the other to complain	28	7
How far I toil still farther off from thee	28	8
I tell the day to please him thou art bright	28	9
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven	28	10
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night	28	11
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even	28	12
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer	28	13
And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger	28	14
When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes	29	1
I all alone beweep my outcast state	29	2
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries	29	3
And look upon myself and curse my fate	29	4
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope	29	5
Featur'd like him like him with friends possess'd	29	6
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope	29	7
With what I most enjoy contented least	29	8
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising	29	9
Haply I think on thee and then my state	29	10
Like to the lark at break of day arising	29	11
From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate	29	12
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings	29	13
That then I scorn to change my state with kings	29	14
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought	30	1
I summon up remembrance of things past	30	2
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought	30	3
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste	30	4
Then can I drown an eye unused to flow	30	5
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night	30	6
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe	30	7
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight	30	8
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone	30	9
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er	30	10
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan	30	11
Which I new pay as if not paid before	30	12
But if the while I think on thee dear friend	30	13
All losses are restor'd and sorrows end	30	14
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts	31	1
Which I by lacking have supposed dead	31	2
And there reigns Love and all Love's loving parts	31	3
And all those friends which I thought buried	31	4
How many a holy and obsequious tear	31	5
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye	31	6
As interest of the dead which now appear	31	7
But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie	31	8
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live	31	9
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone	31	10
Who all their parts of me to thee did give	31	11
That due of many now is thine alone	31	12
Their images I lov'd I view in thee	31	13
And thou--all they--hast all the all of me	31	14
If thou survive my well-contented day	32	1
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover	32	2
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey	32	3
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover	32	4
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time	32	5
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen	32	6
Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme	32	7
Exceeded by the height of happier men	32	8
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought	32	9
Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age	32	10
A dearer birth than this his love had brought	32	11
To march in ranks of better equipage	32	12
But since he died and poets better prove	32	13
Theirs for their style I'll read his for his love	32	14
Full many a glorious morning have I seen	33	1
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye	33	2
Kissing with golden face the meadows green	33	3
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy	33	4
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride	33	5
With ugly rack on his celestial face	33	6
And from the forlorn world his visage hide	33	7
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace	33	8
Even so my sun one early morn did shine	33	9
With all triumphant splendour on my brow	33	10
But out alack he was but one hour mine	33	11
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now	33	12
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth	33	13
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth	33	14
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day	34	1
And make me travel forth without my cloak	34	2
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way	34	3
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke	34	4
Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break	34	5
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face	34	6
For no man well of such a salve can speak	34	7
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace	34	8
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief	34	9
Though thou repent yet I have still the loss	34	10
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief	34	11
To him that bears the strong offence's cross	34	12
Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds	34	13
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds	34	14
No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done	35	1
Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud	35	2
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun	35	3
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud	35	4
All men make faults and even I in this	35	5
Authorizing thy trespass with compare	35	6
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss	35	7
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are	35	8
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense	35	9
Thy adverse party is thy advocate	35	10
And gainst myself a lawful plea commence	35	11
Such civil war is in my love and hate	35	12
That I an accessary needs must be	35	13
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me	35	14
Let me confess that we two must be twain	36	1
Although our undivided loves are one	36	2
So shall those blots that do with me remain	36	3
Without thy help by me be borne alone	36	4
In our two loves there is but one respect	36	5
Though in our lives a separable spite	36	6
Which though it alter not love's sole effect	36	7
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight	36	8
I may not evermore acknowledge thee	36	9
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame	36	10
Nor thou with public kindness honour me	36	11
Unless thou take that honour from thy name	36	12
But do not so I love thee in such sort	36	13
As thou being mine mine is thy good report	36	14
As a decrepit father takes delight	37	1
To see his active child do deeds of youth	37	2
So I made lame by Fortune's dearest spite	37	3
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth	37	4
For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit	37	5
Or any of these all or all or more	37	6
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit	37	7
I make my love engrafted to this store	37	8
So then I am not lame poor nor despis'd	37	9
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give	37	10
That I in thy abundance am suffic'd	37	11
And by a part of all thy glory live	37	12
Look what is best that best I wish in thee	37	13
This wish I have then ten times happy me	37	14
How can my muse want subject to invent	38	1
While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse	38	2
Thine own sweet argument too excellent	38	3
For every vulgar paper to rehearse	38	4
O give thy self the thanks if aught in me	38	5
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight	38	6
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee	38	7
When thou thy self dost give invention light	38	8
Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth	38	9
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate	38	10
And he that calls on thee let him bring forth	38	11
Eternal numbers to outlive long date	38	12
If my slight muse do please these curious days	38	13
The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise	38	14
O how thy worth with manners may I sing	39	1
When thou art all the better part of me	39	2
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring	39	3
And what is't but mine own when I praise thee	39	4
Even for this let us divided live	39	5
And our dear love lose name of single one	39	6
That by this separation I may give	39	7
That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone	39	8
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove	39	9
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave	39	10
To entertain the time with thoughts of love	39	11
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive	39	12
And that thou teachest how to make one twain	39	13
By praising him here who doth hence remain	39	14
Take all my loves my love yea take them all	40	1
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before	40	2
No love my love that thou mayst true love call	40	3
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more	40	4
Then if for my love thou my love receivest	40	5
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest	40	6
But yet be blam'd if thou thy self deceivest	40	7
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest	40	8
I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief	40	9
Although thou steal thee all my poverty	40	10
And yet love knows it is a greater grief	40	11
To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury	40	12
Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows	40	13
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes	40	14
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits	41	1
When I am sometime absent from thy heart	41	2
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits	41	3
For still temptation follows where thou art	41	4
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won	41	5
Beauteous thou art therefore to be assail'd	41	6
And when a woman woos what woman's son	41	7
Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd	41	8
Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear	41	9
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth	41	10
Who lead thee in their riot even there	41	11
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth	41	12
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee	41	13
Thine by thy beauty being false to me	41	14
That thou hast her it is not all my grief	42	1
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly	42	2
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief	42	3
A loss in love that touches me more nearly	42	4
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye	42	5
Thou dost love her because thou know'st I love her	42	6
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me	42	7
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her	42	8
If I lose thee my loss is my love's gain	42	9
And losing her my friend hath found that loss	42	10
Both find each other and I lose both twain	42	11
And both for my sake lay on me this cross	42	12
But here's the joy my friend and I are one	42	13
Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone	42	14
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see	43	1
For all the day they view things unrespected	43	2
But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee	43	3
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed	43	4
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright	43	5
How would thy shadow's form form happy show	43	6
To the clear day with thy much clearer light	43	7
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so	43	8
How would I say mine eyes be blessed made	43	9
By looking on thee in the living day	43	10
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade	43	11
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay	43	12
All days are nights to see till I see thee	43	13
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me	43	14
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought	44	1
Injurious distance should not stop my way	44	2
For then despite of space I would be brought	44	3
From limits far remote where thou dost stay	44	4
No matter then although my foot did stand	44	5
Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee	44	6
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land	44	7
As soon as think the place where he would be	44	8
But ah thought kills me that I am not thought	44	9
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone	44	10
But that so much of earth and water wrought	44	11
I must attend time's leisure with my moan	44	12
Receiving nought by elements so slow	44	13
But heavy tears badges of either's woe	44	14
The other two slight air and purging fire	45	1
Are both with thee wherever I abide	45	2
The first my thought the other my desire	45	3
These present-absent with swift motion slide	45	4
For when these quicker elements are gone	45	5
In tender embassy of love to thee	45	6
My life being made of four with two alone	45	7
Sinks down to death oppress'd with melancholy	45	8
Until life's composition be recur'd	45	9
By those swift messengers return'd from thee	45	10
Who even but now come back again assur'd	45	11
Of thy fair health recounting it to me	45	12
This told I joy but then no longer glad	45	13
I send them back again and straight grow sad	45	14
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war	46	1
How to divide the conquest of thy sight	46	2
Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar	46	3
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right	46	4
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie	46	5
A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes	46	6
But the defendant doth that plea deny	46	7
And says in him thy fair appearance lies	46	8
To side this title is impannelled	46	9
A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart	46	10
And by their verdict is determined	46	11
The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part	46	12
As thus mine eye's due is thy outward part	46	13
And my heart's right thy inward love of heart	46	14
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took	47	1
And each doth good turns now unto the other	47	2
When that mine eye is famish'd for a look	47	3
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother	47	4
With my love's picture then my eye doth feast	47	5
And to the painted banquet bids my heart	47	6
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest	47	7
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part	47	8
So either by thy picture or my love	47	9
Thy self away art present still with me	47	10
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move	47	11
And I am still with them and they with thee	47	12
Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight	47	13
Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight	47	14
How careful was I when I took my way	48	1
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust	48	2
That to my use it might unused stay	48	3
From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust	48	4
But thou to whom my jewels trifles are	48	5
Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief	48	6
Thou best of dearest and mine only care	48	7
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief	48	8
Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest	48	9
Save where thou art not though I feel thou art	48	10
Within the gentle closure of my breast	48	11
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part	48	12
And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear	48	13
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear	48	14
Against that time if ever that time come	49	1
When I shall see thee frown on my defects	49	2
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum	49	3
Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects	49	4
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass	49	5
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye	49	6
When love converted from the thing it was	49	7
Shall reasons find of settled gravity	49	8
Against that time do I ensconce me here	49	9
Within the knowledge of mine own desert	49	10
And this my hand against my self uprear	49	11
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part	49	12
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws	49	13
Since why to love I can allege no cause	49	14
How heavy do I journey on the way	50	1
When what I seek my weary travel's end	50	2
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say	50	3
Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend	50	4
The beast that bears me tired with my woe	50	5
Plods dully on to bear that weight in me	50	6
As if by some instinct the wretch did know	50	7
His rider lov'd not speed being made from thee	50	8
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on	50	9
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide	50	10
Which heavily he answers with a groan	50	11
More sharp to me than spurring to his side	50	12
For that same groan doth put this in my mind	50	13
My grief lies onward and my joy behind	50	14
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence	51	1
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed	51	2
From where thou art why should I haste me thence	51	3
Till I return of posting is no need	51	4
O what excuse will my poor beast then find	51	5
When swift extremity can seem but slow	51	6
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind	51	7
In winged speed n:motion shall I know	51	8
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace	51	9
Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made	51	10
Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race	51	11
But love for love thus shall excuse my jade	51	12
Since from thee going he went wilful-slow	51	13
Towards thee I'll run and give him leave to go	51	14
So am I as the rich whose blessed key	52	1
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure	52	2
The which he will not every hour survey	52	3
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure	52	4
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare	52	5
Since seldom coming in that long year set	52	6
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are	52	7
Or captain jewels in the carcanet	52	8
So is the time that keeps you as my chest	52	9
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide	52	10
To make some special instant special-blest	52	11
By new unfolding his imprison'd pride	52	12
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope	52	13
Being had to triumph being lacked to hope	52	14
What is your substance whereof are you made	53	1
That millions of strange shadows on you tend	53	2
Since every one hath every one one shade	53	3
And you but one can every shadow lend	53	4
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit	53	5
Is poorly imitated after you	53	6
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set	53	7
And you in Grecian tires are painted new	53	8
Speak of the spring and foison of the year	53	9
The one doth shadow of your beauty show	53	10
The other as your bounty doth appear	53	11
And you in every blessed shape we know	53	12
In all external grace you have some part	53	13
But you like none none you for constant heart	53	14
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem	54	1
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give	54	2
The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem	54	3
For that sweet odour which doth in it live	54	4
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye	54	5
As the perfumed tincture of the roses	54	6
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly	54	7
When summer's breath their masked buds discloses	54	8
But for their virtue only is their show	54	9
They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade	54	10
Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so	54	11
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made	54	12
And so of you beauteous and lovely youth	54	13
When that shall vade by verse distills your truth	54	14
Not marble nor the gilded monuments	55	1
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme	55	2
But you shall shine more bright in these contents	55	3
Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time	55	4
When wasteful war shall statues overturn	55	5
And broils root out the work of masonry	55	6
Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn	55	7
The living record of your memory	55	8
Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity	55	9
Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room	55	10
Even in the eyes of all posterity	55	11
That wear this world out to the ending doom	55	12
So till the judgment that yourself arise	55	13
You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes	55	14
Sweet love renew thy force be it not said	56	1
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite	56	2
Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd	56	3
To-morrow sharpened in his former might	56	4
So love be thou although to-day thou fill	56	5
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness	56	6
To-morrow see again and do not kill	56	7
The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness	56	8
Let this sad interim like the ocean be	56	9
Which parts the shore where two contracted new	56	10
Come daily to the banks that when they see	56	11
Return of love more blest may be the view	56	12
Or call it winter which being full of care	56	13
Makes summer's welcome thrice more wished more rare	56	14
Being your slave what should I do but tend	57	1
Upon the hours and times of your desire	57	2
I have no precious time at all to spend	57	3
Nor services to do till you require	57	4
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour	57	5
Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you	57	6
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour	57	7
When you have bid your servant once adieu	57	8
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought	57	9
Where you may be or your affairs suppose	57	10
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought	57	11
Save where you are how happy you make those	57	12
So true a fool is love that in your will	57	13
Though you do anything he thinks no ill	57	14
That god forbid that made me first your slave	58	1
I should in thought control your times of pleasure	58	2
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave	58	3
Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure	58	4
O let me suffer being at your beck	58	5
The imprison'd absence of your liberty	58	6
And patience tame to sufferance bide each check	58	7
Without accusing you of injury	58	8
Be where you list your charter is so strong	58	9
That you yourself may privilage your time	58	10
To what you will to you it doth belong	58	11
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime	58	12
I am to wait though waiting so be hell	58	13
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well	58	14
If there be nothing new but that which is	59	1
Hath been before how are our brains beguil'd	59	2
Which labouring for invention bear amiss	59	3
The second burthen of a former child	59	4
O that record could with a backward look	59	5
Even of five hundred courses of the sun	59	6
Show me your image in some antique book	59	7
Since mind at first in character was done	59	8
That I might see what the old world could say	59	9
To this composed wonder of your frame	59	10
Wh'r we are mended or wh'r better they	59	11
Or whether revolution be the same	59	12
O sure I am the wits of former days	59	13
To subjects worse have given admiring praise	59	14
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore	60	1
So do our minutes hasten to their end	60	2
Each changing place with that which goes before	60	3
In sequent toil all forwards do contend	60	4
Nativity once in the main of light	60	5
Crawls to maturity wherewith being crown'd	60	6
Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight	60	7
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound	60	8
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth	60	9
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow	60	10
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth	60	11
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow	60	12
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand	60	13
Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand	60	14
Is it thy will thy image should keep open	61	1
My heavy eyelids to the weary night	61	2
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken	61	3
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight	61	4
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee	61	5
So far from home into my deeds to pry	61	6
To find out shames and idle hours in me	61	7
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy	61	8
O no thy love though much is not so great	61	9
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake	61	10
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat	61	11
To play the watchman ever for thy sake	61	12
For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere	61	13
From me far off with others all too near	61	14
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye	62	1
And all my soul and all my every part	62	2
And for this sin there is no remedy	62	3
It is so grounded inward in my heart	62	4
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine	62	5
No shape so true no truth of such account	62	6
And for myself mine own worth do define	62	7
As I all other in all worths surmount	62	8
But when my glass shows me myself indeed	62	9
Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity	62	10
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read	62	11
Self so self-loving were iniquity	62	12
Tis thee,--myself,--that for myself I praise	62	13
Painting my age with beauty of thy days	62	14
Against my love shall be as I am now	63	1
With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn	63	2
When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow	63	3
With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn	63	4
Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night	63	5
And all those beauties whereof now he's king	63	6
Are vanishing or vanished out of sight	63	7
Stealing away the treasure of his spring	63	8
For such a time do I now fortify	63	9
Against confounding age's cruel knife	63	10
That he shall never cut from memory	63	11
My sweet love's beauty though my lover's life	63	12
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen	63	13
And they shall live and he in them still green	63	14
When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd	64	1
The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age	64	2
When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd	64	3
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage	64	4
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain	64	5
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore	64	6
And the firm soil win of the watery main	64	7
Increasing store with loss and loss with store	64	8
When I have seen such interchange of state	64	9
Or state itself confounded to decay	64	10
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate	64	11
That Time will come and take my love away	64	12
This thought is as a death which cannot choose	64	13
But weep to have that which it fears to lose	64	14
Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea	65	1
But sad mortality o'ersways their power	65	2
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea	65	3
Whose action is no stronger than a flower	65	4
O how shall summer's honey breath hold out	65	5
Against the wrackful siege of battering days	65	6
When rocks impregnable are not so stout	65	7
Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays	65	8
O fearful meditation where alack	65	9
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid	65	10
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back	65	11
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid	65	12
O none unless this miracle have might	65	13
That in black ink my love may still shine bright	65	14
Tired with all these for restful death I cry	66	1
As to behold desert a beggar born	66	2
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity	66	3
And purest faith unhappily forsworn	66	4
And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd	66	5
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted	66	6
And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd	66	7
And strength by limping sway disabled	66	8
And art made tongue-tied by authority	66	9
And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill	66	10
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity	66	11
And captive good attending captain ill	66	12
Tir'd with all these from these would I be gone	66	13
Save that to die I leave my love alone	66	14
Ah wherefore with infection should he live	67	1
And with his presence grace impiety	67	2
That sin by him advantage should achieve	67	3
And lace itself with his society	67	4
Why should false painting imitate his cheek	67	5
And steel dead seeming of his living hue	67	6
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek	67	7
Roses of shadow since his rose is true	67	8
Why should he live now Nature bankrupt is	67	9
Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins	67	10
For she hath no exchequer now but his	67	11
And proud of many lives upon his gains	67	12
O him she stores to show what wealth she had	67	13
In days long since before these last so bad	67	14
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn	68	1
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now	68	2
Before these bastard signs of fair were born	68	3
Or durst inhabit on a living brow	68	4
Before the golden tresses of the dead	68	5
The right of sepulchres were shorn away	68	6
To live a second life on second head	68	7
Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay	68	8
In him those holy antique hours are seen	68	9
Without all ornament itself and true	68	10
Making no summer of another's green	68	11
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new	68	12
And him as for a map doth Nature store	68	13
To show false Art what beauty was of yore	68	14
Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view	69	1
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend	69	2
All tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due	69	3
Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend	69	4
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd	69	5
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own	69	6
In other accents do this praise confound	69	7
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown	69	8
They look into the beauty of thy mind	69	9
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds	69	10
Then--churls--their thoughts although their eyes were kind	69	11
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds	69	12
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show	69	13
The soil is this that thou dost common grow	69	14
That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect	70	1
For slander's mark was ever yet the fair	70	2
The ornament of beauty is suspect	70	3
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air	70	4
So thou be good slander doth but approve	70	5
Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time	70	6
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love	70	7
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime	70	8
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days	70	9
Either not assail'd or victor being charg'd	70	10
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise	70	11
To tie up envy evermore enlarg'd	70	12
If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show	70	13
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe	70	14
No longer mourn for me when I am dead	71	1
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell	71	2
Give warning to the world that I am fled	71	3
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell	71	4
Nay if you read this line remember not	71	5
The hand that writ it for I love you so	71	6
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot	71	7
If thinking on me then should make you woe	71	8
O if,--I say you look upon this verse	71	9
When I perhaps compounded am with clay	71	10
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse	71	11
But let your love even with my life decay	71	12
Lest the wise world should look into your moan	71	13
And mock you with me after I am gone	71	14
O lest the world should task you to recite	72	1
What merit lived in me that you should love	72	2
After my death,--dear love forget me quite	72	3
For you in me can nothing worthy prove	72	4
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie	72	5
To do more for me than mine own desert	72	6
And hang more praise upon deceased I	72	7
Than niggard truth would willingly impart	72	8
O lest your true love may seem false in this	72	9
That you for love speak well of me untrue	72	10
My name be buried where my body is	72	11
And live no more to shame nor me nor you	72	12
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth	72	13
And so should you to love things nothing worth	72	14
That time of year thou mayst in me behold	73	1
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang	73	2
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold	73	3
Bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang	73	4
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day	73	5
As after sunset fadeth in the west	73	6
Which by and by black night doth take away	73	7
Death's second self that seals up all in rest	73	8
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire	73	9
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie	73	10
As the death-bed whereon it must expire	73	11
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by	73	12
This thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong	73	13
To love that well which thou must leave ere long	73	14
But be contented when that fell arrest	74	1
Without all bail shall carry me away	74	2
My life hath in this line some interest	74	3
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay	74	4
When thou reviewest this thou dost review	74	5
The very part was consecrate to thee	74	6
The earth can have but earth which is his due	74	7
My spirit is thine the better part of me	74	8
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life	74	9
The prey of worms my body being dead	74	10
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife	74	11
Too base of thee to be remembered	74	12
The worth of that is that which it contains	74	13
And that is this and this with thee remains	74	14
So are you to my thoughts as food to life	75	1
Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground	75	2
And for the peace of you I hold such strife	75	3
As twixt a miser and his wealth is found	75	4
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon	75	5
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure	75	6
Now counting best to be with you alone	75	7
Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure	75	8
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight	75	9
And by and by clean starved for a look	75	10
Possessing or pursuing no delight	75	11
Save what is had or must from you be took	75	12
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day	75	13
Or gluttoning on all or all away	75	14
Why is my verse so barren of new pride	76	1
So far from variation or quick change	76	2
Why with the time do I not glance aside	76	3
To new-found methods and to compounds strange	76	4
Why write I still all one ever the same	76	5
And keep invention in a noted weed	76	6
That every word doth almost tell my name	76	7
Showing their birth and where they did proceed	76	8
O know sweet love I always write of you	76	9
And you and love are still my argument	76	10
So all my best is dressing old words new	76	11
Spending again what is already spent	76	12
For as the sun is daily new and old	76	13
So is my love still telling what is told	76	14
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear	77	1
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste	77	2
These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear	77	3
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste	77	4
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show	77	5
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory	77	6
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know	77	7
Time's thievish progress to eternity	77	8
Look what thy memory cannot contain	77	9
Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find	77	10
Those children nursed deliver'd from thy brain	77	11
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind	77	12
These offices so oft as thou wilt look	77	13
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book	77	14
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse	78	1
And found such fair assistance in my verse	78	2
As every alien pen hath got my use	78	3
And under thee their poesy disperse	78	4
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing	78	5
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly	78	6
Have added feathers to the learned's wing	78	7
And given grace a double majesty	78	8
Yet be most proud of that which I compile	78	9
Whose influence is thine and born of thee	78	10
In others works thou dost but mend the style	78	11
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be	78	12
But thou art all my art and dost advance	78	13
As high as learning my rude ignorance	78	14
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid	79	1
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace	79	2
But now my gracious numbers are decay'd	79	3
And my sick Muse doth give an other place	79	4
I grant sweet love thy lovely argument	79	5
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen	79	6
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent	79	7
He robs thee of and pays it thee again	79	8
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word	79	9
From thy behaviour beauty doth he give	79	10
And found it in thy cheek he can afford	79	11
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live	79	12
Then thank him not for that which he doth say	79	13
Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay	79	14
O how I faint when I of you do write	80	1
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name	80	2
And in the praise thereof spends all his might	80	3
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame	80	4
But since your worth--wide as the ocean is	80	5
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear	80	6
My saucy bark inferior far to his	80	7
On your broad main doth wilfully appear	80	8
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat	80	9
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride	80	10
Or being wrack'd I am a worthless boat	80	11
He of tall building and of goodly pride	80	12
Then if he thrive and I be cast away	80	13
The worst was this,--my love was my decay	80	14
Or I shall live your epitaph to make	81	1
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten	81	2
From hence your memory death cannot take	81	3
Although in me each part will be forgotten	81	4
Your name from hence immortal life shall have	81	5
Though I once gone to all the world must die	81	6
The earth can yield me but a common grave	81	7
When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie	81	8
Your monument shall be my gentle verse	81	9
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read	81	10
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse	81	11
When all the breathers of this world are dead	81	12
You still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen	81	13
Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men	81	14
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse	82	1
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook	82	2
The dedicated words which writers use	82	3
Of their fair subject blessing every book	82	4
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue	82	5
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise	82	6
And therefore art enforced to seek anew	82	7
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days	82	8
And do so love yet when they have devis'd	82	9
What strained touches rhetoric can lend	82	10
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathiz'd	82	11
In true plain words by thy true-telling friend	82	12
And their gross painting might be better us'd	82	13
Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abus'd	82	14
I never saw that you did painting need	83	1
And therefore to your fair no painting set	83	2
I found or thought I found you did exceed	83	3
That barren tender of a poet's debt	83	4
And therefore have I slept in your report	83	5
That you yourself being extant well might show	83	6
How far a modern quill doth come too short	83	7
Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow	83	8
This silence for my sin you did impute	83	9
Which shall be most my glory being dumb	83	10
For I impair not beauty being mute	83	11
When others would give life and bring a tomb	83	12
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes	83	13
Than both your poets can in praise devise	83	14
Who is it that says most which can say more	84	1
Than this rich praise,--that you alone are you	84	2
In whose confine immured is the store	84	3
Which should example where your equal grew	84	4
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell	84	5
That to his subject lends not some small glory	84	6
But he that writes of you if he can tell	84	7
That you are you so dignifies his story	84	8
Let him but copy what in you is writ	84	9
Not making worse what nature made so clear	84	10
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit	84	11
Making his style admired every where	84	12
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse	84	13
Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse	84	14
My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still	85	1
While comments of your praise richly compil'd	85	2
Reserve their character with golden quill	85	3
And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd	85	4
I think good thoughts whilst others write good words	85	5
And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen	85	6
To every hymn that able spirit affords	85	7
In polish'd form of well-refined pen	85	8
Hearing you praised I say tis so tis true	85	9
And to the most of praise add something more	85	10
But that is in my thought whose love to you	85	11
Though words come hindmost holds his rank before	85	12
Then others for the breath of words respect	85	13
Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect	85	14
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse	86	1
Bound for the prize of all too precious you	86	2
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse	86	3
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew	86	4
Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write	86	5
Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead	86	6
No neither he nor his compeers by night	86	7
Giving him aid my verse astonished	86	8
He nor that affable familiar ghost	86	9
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence	86	10
As victors of my silence cannot boast	86	11
I was not sick of any fear from thence	86	12
But when your countenance fill'd up his line	86	13
Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine	86	14
Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing	87	1
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate	87	2
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing	87	3
My bonds in thee are all determinate	87	4
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting	87	5
And for that riches where is my deserving	87	6
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting	87	7
And so my patent back again is swerving	87	8
Thy self thou gav'st thy own worth then not knowing	87	9
Or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking	87	10
So thy great gift upon misprision growing	87	11
Comes home again on better judgement making	87	12
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter	87	13
In sleep a king but waking no such matter	87	14
When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light	88	1
And place my merit in the eye of scorn	88	2
Upon thy side against myself I'll fight	88	3
And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn	88	4
With mine own weakness being best acquainted	88	5
Upon thy part I can set down a story	88	6
Of faults conceal'd wherein I am attainted	88	7
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory	88	8
And I by this will be a gainer too	88	9
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee	88	10
The injuries that to myself I do	88	11
Doing thee vantage double-vantage me	88	12
Such is my love to thee I so belong	88	13
That for thy right myself will bear all wrong	88	14
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault	89	1
And I will comment upon that offence	89	2
Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt	89	3
Against thy reasons making no defence	89	4
Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill	89	5
To set a form upon desired change	89	6
As I'll myself disgrace knowing thy will	89	7
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange	89	8
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue	89	9
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell	89	10
Lest I too much profane should do it wrong	89	11
And haply of our old acquaintance tell	89	12
For thee against my self I'll vow debate	89	13
For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate	89	14
Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now	90	1
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross	90	2
Join with the spite of fortune make me bow	90	3
And do not drop in for an after-loss	90	4
Ah do not when my heart hath scap'd this sorrow	90	5
Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe	90	6
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow	90	7
To linger out a purpos'd overthrow	90	8
If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last	90	9
When other petty griefs have done their spite	90	10
But in the onset come so shall I taste	90	11
At first the very worst of fortune's might	90	12
And other strains of woe which now seem woe	90	13
Compar'd with loss of thee will not seem so	90	14
Some glory in their birth some in their skill	91	1
Some in their wealth some in their body's force	91	2
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill	91	3
Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse	91	4
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure	91	5
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest	91	6
But these particulars are not my measure	91	7
All these I better in one general best	91	8
Thy love is better than high birth to me	91	9
Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs	91	10
Of more delight than hawks and horses be	91	11
And having thee of all men's pride I boast	91	12
Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take	91	13
All this away and me most wretchcd make	91	14
But do thy worst to steal thyself away	92	1
For term of life thou art assured mine	92	2
And life no longer than thy love will stay	92	3
For it depends upon that love of thine	92	4
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs	92	5
When in the least of them my life hath end	92	6
I see a better state to me belongs	92	7
Than that which on thy humour doth depend	92	8
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind	92	9
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie	92	10
O what a happy title do I find	92	11
Happy to have thy love happy to die	92	12
But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot	92	13
Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not	92	14
So shall I live supposing thou art true	93	1
Like a deceived husband so love's face	93	2
May still seem love to me though alter'd new	93	3
Thy looks with me thy heart in other place	93	4
For there can live no hatred in thine eye	93	5
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change	93	6
In many's looks the false heart's history	93	7
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange	93	8
But heaven in thy creation did decree	93	9
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell	93	10
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be	93	11
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell	93	12
How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow	93	13
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show	93	14
They that have power to hurt and will do none	94	1
That do not do the thing they most do show	94	2
Who moving others are themselves as stone	94	3
Unmoved cold and to temptation slow	94	4
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces	94	5
And husband nature's riches from expense	94	6
They are the lords and owners of their faces	94	7
Others but stewards of their excellence	94	8
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet	94	9
Though to itself it only live and die	94	10
But if that flower with base infection meet	94	11
The basest weed outbraves his dignity	94	12
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds	94	13
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds	94	14
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame	95	1
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose	95	2
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name	95	3
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose	95	4
That tongue that tells the story of thy days	95	5
Making lascivious comments on thy sport	95	6
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise	95	7
Naming thy name blesses an ill report	95	8
O what a mansion have those vices got	95	9
Which for their habitation chose out thee	95	10
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot	95	11
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see	95	12
Take heed dear heart of this large privilege	95	13
The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge	95	14
Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness	96	1
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport	96	2
Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less	96	3
Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort	96	4
As on the finger of a throned queen	96	5
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd	96	6
So are those errors that in thee are seen	96	7
To truths translated and for true things deem'd	96	8
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray	96	9
If like a lamb he could his looks translate	96	10
How many gazers mightst thou lead away	96	11
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state	96	12
But do not so I love thee in such sort	96	13
As thou being mine mine is thy good report	96	14
How like a winter hath my absence been	97	1
From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year	97	2
What freezings have I felt what dark days seen	97	3
What old December's bareness everywhere	97	4
And yet this time removed was summer's time	97	5
The teeming autumn big with rich increase	97	6
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime	97	7
Like widow'd wombs after their lords decease	97	8
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me	97	9
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit	97	10
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee	97	11
And thou away the very birds are mute	97	12
Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer	97	13
That leaves look pale dreading the winter's near	97	14
From you have I been absent in the spring	98	1
When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim	98	2
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing	98	3
That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him	98	4
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell	98	5
Of different flowers in odour and in hue	98	6
Could make me any summer's story tell	98	7
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew	98	8
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white	98	9
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose	98	10
They were but sweet but figures of delight	98	11
Drawn after you you pattern of all those	98	12
Yet seem'd it winter still and you away	98	13
As with your shadow I with these did play	98	14
The forward violet thus did I chide	99	1
Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells	99	2
If not from my love's breath The purple pride	99	3
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells	99	4
In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd	99	5
The lily I condemned for thy hand	99	6
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair	99	7
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand	99	8
One blushing shame another white despair	99	9
A third nor red nor white had stol'n of both	99	10
And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath	99	11
But for his theft in pride of all his growth	99	12
A vengeful canker eat him up to death	99	13
More flowers I noted yet I none could see	99	14
But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee	99	15
Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long	100	1
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might	100	2
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song	100	3
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light	100	4
Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem	100	5
In gentle numbers time so idly spent	100	6
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem	100	7
And gives thy pen both skill and argument	100	8
Rise resty Muse my love's sweet face survey	100	9
If Time have any wrinkle graven there	100	10
If any be a satire to decay	100	11
And make time's spoils despised every where	100	12
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life	100	13
So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife	100	14
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends	101	1
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd	101	2
Both truth and beauty on my love depends	101	3
So dost thou too and therein dignified	101	4
Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say	101	5
Truth needs no colour with his colour fix'd	101	6
Beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay	101	7
But best is best if never intermix'd	101	8
Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb	101	9
Excuse not silence so for't lies in thee	101	10
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb	101	11
And to be prais'd of ages yet to be	101	12
Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how	101	13
To make him seem long hence as he shows now	101	14
My love is strengthen'd though more weak in seeming	102	1
I love not less though less the show appear	102	2
That love is merchandiz'd whose rich esteeming	102	3
The owner's tongue doth publish every where	102	4
Our love was new and then but in the spring	102	5
When I was wont to greet it with my lays	102	6
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing	102	7
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days	102	8
Not that the summer is less pleasant now	102	9
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night	102	10
But that wild music burthens every bough	102	11
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight	102	12
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue	102	13
Because I would not dull you with my song	102	14
Alack what poverty my Muse brings forth	103	1
That having such a scope to show her pride	103	2
The argument all bare is of more worth	103	3
Than when it hath my added praise beside	103	4
O blame me not if I no more can write	103	5
Look in your glass and there appears a face	103	6
That over-goes my blunt invention quite	103	7
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace	103	8
Were it not sinful then striving to mend	103	9
To mar the subject that before was well	103	10
For to no other pass my verses tend	103	11
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell	103	12
And more much more than in my verse can sit	103	13
Your own glass shows you when you look in it	103	14
To me fair friend you never can be old	104	1
For as you were when first your eye I ey'd	104	2
Such seems your beauty still Three winters cold	104	3
Have from the forests shook three summers pride	104	4
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd	104	5
In process of the seasons have I seen	104	6
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd	104	7
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green	104	8
Ah yet doth beauty like a dial-hand	104	9
Steal from his figure and no pace perceiv'd	104	10
So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand	104	11
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceiv'd	104	12
For fear of which hear this thou age unbred	104	13
Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead	104	14
Let not my love be call'd idolatry	105	1
Nor my beloved as an idol show	105	2
Since all alike my songs and praises be	105	3
To one of one still such and ever so	105	4
Kind is my love to-day to-morrow kind	105	5
Still constant in a wondrous excellence	105	6
Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd	105	7
One thing expressing leaves out difference	105	8
Fair kind and true is all my argument	105	9
Fair kind and true varying to other words	105	10
And in this change is my invention spent	105	11
Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords	105	12
Fair kind and true have often liv'd alone	105	13
Which three till now never kept seat in one	105	14
When in the chronicle of wasted time	106	1
I see descriptions of the fairest wights	106	2
And beauty making beautiful old rime	106	3
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights	106	4
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best	106	5
Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow	106	6
I see their antique pen would have express'd	106	7
Even such a beauty as you master now	106	8
So all their praises are but prophecies	106	9
Of this our time all you prefiguring	106	10
And for they looked but with divining eyes	106	11
They had not skill enough your worth to sing	106	12
For we which now behold these present days	106	13
Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise	106	14
Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul	107	1
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come	107	2
Can yet the lease of my true love control	107	3
Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom	107	4
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd	107	5
And the sad augurs mock their own presage	107	6
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd	107	7
And peace proclaims olives of endless age	107	8
Now with the drops of this most balmy time	107	9
My love looks fresh and Death to me subscribes	107	10
Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rime	107	11
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes	107	12
And thou in this shalt find thy monument	107	13
When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent	107	14
What's in the brain that ink may character	108	1
Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit	108	2
What's new to speak what now to register	108	3
That may express my love or thy dear merit	108	4
Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine	108	5
I must each day say o'er the very same	108	6
Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine	108	7
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name	108	8
So that eternal love in love's fresh case	108	9
Weighs not the dust and injury of age	108	10
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place	108	11
But makes antiquity for aye his page	108	12
Finding the first conceit of love there bred	108	13
Where time and outward form would show it dead	108	14
O never say that I was false of heart	109	1
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify	109	2
As easy might I from my self depart	109	3
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie	109	4
That is my home of love if I have rang'd	109	5
Like him that travels I return again	109	6
Just to the time not with the time exchang'd	109	7
So that myself bring water for my stain	109	8
Never believe though in my nature reign'd	109	9
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood	109	10
That it could so preposterously be stain'd	109	11
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good	109	12
For nothing this wide universe I call	109	13
Save thou my rose in it thou art my all	109	14
Alas tis true I have gone here and there	110	1
And made my self a motley to the view	110	2
Gor'd mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear	110	3
Made old offences of affections new	110	4
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth	110	5
Askance and strangely but by all above	110	6
These blenches gave my heart another youth	110	7
And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love	110	8
Now all is done save what shall have no end	110	9
Mine appetite I never more will grind	110	10
On newer proof to try an older friend	110	11
A god in love to whom I am confin'd	110	12
Then give me welcome next my heaven the best	110	13
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast	110	14
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide	111	1
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds	111	2
That did not better for my life provide	111	3
Than public means which public manners breeds	111	4
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand	111	5
And almost thence my nature is subdu'd	111	6
To what it works in like the dyer's hand	111	7
Pity me then and wish I were renew'd	111	8
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink	111	9
Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection	111	10
No bitterness that I will bitter think	111	11
Nor double penance to correct correction	111	12
Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye	111	13
Even that your pity is enough to cure me	111	14
Your love and pity doth the impression fill	112	1
Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow	112	2
For what care I who calls me well or ill	112	3
So you o'er-green my bad my good allow	112	4
You are my all-the-world and I must strive	112	5
To know my shames and praises from your tongue	112	6
None else to me nor I to none alive	112	7
That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong	112	8
In so profound abysm I throw all care	112	9
Of others voices that my adder's sense	112	10
To critic and to flatterer stopped are	112	11
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense	112	12
You are so strongly in my purpose bred	112	13
That all the world besides methinks are dead	112	14
Since I left you mine eye is in my mind	113	1
And that which governs me to go about	113	2
Doth part his function and is partly blind	113	3
Seems seeing but effectually is out	113	4
For it no form delivers to the heart	113	5
Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch	113	6
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part	113	7
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch	113	8
For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight	113	9
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature	113	10
The mountain or the sea the day or night	113	11
The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature	113	12
Incapable of more replete with you	113	13
My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue	113	14
Or whether doth my mind being crown'd with you	114	1
Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery	114	2
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true	114	3
And that your love taught it this alchemy	114	4
To make of monsters and things indigest	114	5
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble	114	6
Creating every bad a perfect best	114	7
As fast as objects to his beams assemble	114	8
O tis the first tis flattery in my seeing	114	9
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up	114	10
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing	114	11
And to his palate doth prepare the cup	114	12
If it be poison'd tis the lesser sin	114	13
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin	114	14
Those lines that I before have writ do lie	115	1
Even those that said I could not love you dearer	115	2
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why	115	3
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer	115	4
But reckoning Time whose million'd accidents	115	5
Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings	115	6
Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents	115	7
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things	115	8
Alas why fearing of Time's tyranny	115	9
Might I not then say Now I love you best	115	10
When I was certain o'er incertainty	115	11
Crowning the present doubting of the rest	115	12
Love is a babe then might I not say so	115	13
To give full growth to that which still doth grow	115	14
Let me not to the marriage of true minds	116	1
Admit impediments Love is not love	116	2
Which alters when it alteration finds	116	3
Or bends with the remover to remove	116	4
O no it is an ever-fixed mark	116	5
That looks on tempests and is never shaken	116	6
It is the star to every wandering bark	116	7
Whose worth's unknown although his height be taken	116	8
Love's not Time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks	116	9
Within his bending sickle's compass come	116	10
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks	116	11
But bears it out even to the edge of doom	116	12
If this be error and upon me prov'd	116	13
I never writ nor no man ever lov'd	116	14
Accuse me thus that I have scanted all	117	1
Wherein I should your great deserts repay	117	2
Forgot upon your dearest love to call	117	3
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day	117	4
That I have frequent been with unknown minds	117	5
And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right	117	6
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds	117	7
Which should transport me farthest from your sight	117	8
Book both my wilfulness and errors down	117	9
And on just proof surmise accumulate	117	10
Bring me within the level of your frown	117	11
But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate	117	12
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove	117	13
The constancy and virtue of your love	117	14
Like as to make our appetite more keen	118	1
With eager compounds we our palate urge	118	2
As to prevent our maladies unseen	118	3
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge	118	4
Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness	118	5
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding	118	6
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness	118	7
To be diseas'd ere that there was true needing	118	8
Thus policy in love to anticipate	118	9
The ills that were not grew to faults assur'd	118	10
And brought to medicine a healthful state	118	11
Which rank of goodness would by ill be cur'd	118	12
But thence I learn and find the lesson true	118	13
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you	118	14
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears	119	1
Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within	119	2
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears	119	3
Still losing when I saw myself to win	119	4
What wretched errors hath my heart committed	119	5
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never	119	6
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted	119	7
In the distraction of this madding fever	119	8
O benefit of ill now I find true	119	9
That better is by evil still made better	119	10
And ruin'd love when it is built anew	119	11
Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater	119	12
So I return rebuk'd to my content	119	13
And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent	119	14
That you were once unkind befriends me now	120	1
And for that sorrow which I then did feel	120	2
Needs must I under my transgression bow	120	3
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel	120	4
For if you were by my unkindness shaken	120	5
As I by yours you've pass'd a hell of time	120	6
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken	120	7
To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime	120	8
O that our night of woe might have remember'd	120	9
My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits	120	10
And soon to you as you to me then tender'd	120	11
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits	120	12
But that your trespass now becomes a fee	120	13
Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me	120	14
Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd	121	1
When not to be receives reproach of being	121	2
And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd	121	3
Not by our feeling but by others seeing	121	4
For why should others false adulterate eyes	121	5
Give salutation to my sportive blood	121	6
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies	121	7
Which in their wills count bad what I think good	121	8
No I am that I am and they that level	121	9
At my abuses reckon up their own	121	10
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel	121	11
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown	121	12
Unless this general evil they maintain	121	13
All men are bad and in their badness reign	121	14
Thy gift thy tables are within my brain	122	1
Full character'd with lasting memory	122	2
Which shall above that idle rank remain	122	3
Beyond all date even to eternity	122	4
Or at the least so long as brain and heart	122	5
Have faculty by nature to subsist	122	6
Till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part	122	7
Of thee thy record never can be miss'd	122	8
That poor retention could not so much hold	122	9
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score	122	10
Therefore to give them from me was I bold	122	11
To trust those tables that receive thee more	122	12
To keep an adjunct to remember thee	122	13
Were to import forgetfulness in me	122	14
No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change	123	1
Thy pyramids built up with newer might	123	2
To me are nothing novel nothing strange	123	3
They are but dressings of a former sight	123	4
Our dates are brief and therefore we admire	123	5
What thou dost foist upon us that is old	123	6
And rather make them born to our desire	123	7
Than think that we before have heard them told	123	8
Thy registers and thee I both defy	123	9
Not wondering at the present nor the past	123	10
For thy records and what we see doth lie	123	11
Made more or less by thy continual haste	123	12
This I do vow and this shall ever be	123	13
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee	123	14
If my dear love were but the child of state	124	1
It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd	124	2
As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate	124	3
Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gather'd	124	4
No it was builded far from accident	124	5
It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls	124	6
Under the blow of thralled discontent	124	7
Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls	124	8
It fears not policy that heretic	124	9
Which works on leases of short-number'd hours	124	10
But all alone stands hugely politic	124	11
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers	124	12
To this I witness call the fools of time	124	13
Which die for goodness who have lived for crime	124	14
Were't aught to me I bore the canopy	125	1
With my extern the outward honouring	125	2
Or laid great bases for eternity	125	3
Which proves more short than waste or ruining	125	4
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour	125	5
Lose all and more by paying too much rent	125	6
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour	125	7
Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent	125	8
No let me be obsequious in thy heart	125	9
And take thou my oblation poor but free	125	10
Which is not mix'd with seconds knows no art	125	11
But mutual render only me for thee	125	12
Hence thou suborned informer a true soul	125	13
When most impeach'd stands least in thy control	125	14
O thou my lovely boy who in thy power	126	1
Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour	126	2
Who hast by waning grown and therein show'st	126	3
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st	126	4
If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack	126	5
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back	126	6
She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill	126	7
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill	126	8
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure	126	9
She may detain but not still keep her treasure	126	10
Her audit though delayed answered must be	126	11
And her quietus is to render thee	126	12
In the old age black was not counted fair	127	1
Or if it were it bore not beauty's name	127	2
But now is black beauty's successive heir	127	3
And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame	127	4
For since each hand hath put on Nature's power	127	5
Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face	127	6
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower	127	7
But is profan'd if not lives in disgrace	127	8
Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black	127	9
Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem	127	10
At such who not born fair no beauty lack	127	11
Sland'ring creation with a false esteem	127	12
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe	127	13
That every tongue says beauty should look so	127	14
How oft when thou my music music play'st	128	1
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds	128	2
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st	128	3
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds	128	4
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap	128	5
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand	128	6
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap	128	7
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand	128	8
To be so tickled they would change their state	128	9
And situation with those dancing chips	128	10
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait	128	11
Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips	128	12
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this	128	13
Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss	128	14
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame	129	1
Is lust in action and till action lust	129	2
Is perjur'd murderous bloody full of blame	129	3
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust	129	4
Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight	129	5
Past reason hunted and no sooner had	129	6
Past reason hated as a swallow'd bait	129	7
On purpose laid to make the taker mad	129	8
Mad in pursuit and in possession so	129	9
Had having and in quest to have extreme	129	10
A bliss in proof and prov'd a very woe	129	11
Before a joy propos'd behind a dream	129	12
All this the world well knows yet none knows well	129	13
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell	129	14
My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun	130	1
Coral is far more red than her lips red	130	2
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun	130	3
If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head	130	4
I have seen roses damask'd red and white	130	5
But no such roses see I in her cheeks	130	6
And in some perfumes is there more delight	130	7
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks	130	8
I love to hear her speak yet well I know	130	9
That music hath a far more pleasing sound	130	10
I grant I never saw a goddess go	130	11
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground	130	12
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare	130	13
As any she belied with false compare	130	14
Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art	131	1
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel	131	2
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart	131	3
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel	131	4
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold	131	5
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan	131	6
To say they err I dare not be so bold	131	7
Although I swear it to myself alone	131	8
And to be sure that is not false I swear	131	9
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face	131	10
One on another's neck do witness bear	131	11
Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place	131	12
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds	131	13
And thence this slander as I think proceeds	131	14
Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me	132	1
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain	132	2
Have put on black and loving mourners be	132	3
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain	132	4
And truly not the morning sun of heaven	132	5
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east	132	6
Nor that full star that ushers in the even	132	7
Doth half that glory to the sober west	132	8
As those two mourning eyes become thy face	132	9
O let it then as well beseem thy heart	132	10
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace	132	11
And suit thy pity like in every part	132	12
Then will I swear beauty herself is black	132	13
And all they foul that thy complexion lack	132	14
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan	133	1
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me	133	2
Is't not enough to torture me alone	133	3
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be	133	4
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken	133	5
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd	133	6
Of him myself and thee I am forsaken	133	7
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross'd	133	8
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward	133	9
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail	133	10
Whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard	133	11
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail	133	12
And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee	133	13
Perforce am thine and all that is in me	133	14
So now I have confess'd that he is thine	134	1
And I my self am mortgag'd to thy will	134	2
Myself I'll forfeit so that other mine	134	3
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still	134	4
But thou wilt not nor he will not be free	134	5
For thou art covetous and he is kind	134	6
He learn'd but surety-like to write for me	134	7
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind	134	8
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take	134	9
Thou usurer that putt'st forth all to use	134	10
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake	134	11
So him I lose through my unkind abuse	134	12
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me	134	13
He pays the whole and yet am I not free	134	14
Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy Will	135	1
And Will to boot and Will in over-plus	135	2
More than enough am I that vex'd thee still	135	3
To thy sweet will making addition thus	135	4
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious	135	5
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine	135	6
Shall will in others seem right gracious	135	7
And in my will no fair acceptance shine	135	8
The sea all water yet receives rain still	135	9
And in abundance addeth to his store	135	10
So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will	135	11
One will of mine to make thy large will more	135	12
Let no unkind No fair beseechers kill	135	13
Think all but one and me in that one Will	135	14
If thy soul check thee that I come so near	136	1
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will	136	2
And will thy soul knows is admitted there	136	3
Thus far for love my love-suit sweet fulfil	136	4
Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love	136	5
Ay fill it full with wills and my will one	136	6
In things of great receipt with ease we prove	136	7
Among a number one is reckon'd none	136	8
Then in the number let me pass untold	136	9
Though in thy store's account I one must be	136	10
For nothing hold me so it please thee hold	136	11
That nothing me a something sweet to thee	136	12
Make but my name thy love and love that still	136	13
And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will	136	14
Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes	137	1
That they behold and see not what they see	137	2
They know what beauty is see where it lies	137	3
Yet what the best is take the worst to be	137	4
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks	137	5
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride	137	6
Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks	137	7
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied	137	8
Why should my heart think that a several plot	137	9
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place	137	10
Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not	137	11
To put fair truth upon so foul a face	137	12
In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd	137	13
And to this false plague are they now transferr'd	137	14
When my love swears that she is made of truth	138	1
I do believe her though I know she lies	138	2
That she might think me some untutor'd youth	138	3
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties	138	4
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young	138	5
Although she knows my days are past the best	138	6
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue	138	7
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed	138	8
But wherefore says she not she is unjust	138	9
And wherefore say not I that I am old	138	10
O love's best habit is in seeming trust	138	11
And age in love loves not to have years told	138	12
Therefore I lie with her and she with me	138	13
And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be	138	14
O call not me to justify the wrong	139	1
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart	139	2
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue	139	3
Use power with power and slay me not by art	139	4
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere but in my sight	139	5
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside	139	6
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might	139	7
Is more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide	139	8
Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows	139	9
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies	139	10
And therefore from my face she turns my foes	139	11
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries	139	12
Yet do not so but since I am near slain	139	13
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain	139	14
Be wise as thou art cruel do not press	140	1
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain	140	2
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express	140	3
The manner of my pity-wanting pain	140	4
If I might teach thee wit better it were	140	5
Though not to love yet love to tell me so	140	6
As testy sick men when their deaths be near	140	7
No news but health from their physicians know	140	8
For if I should despair I should grow mad	140	9
And in my madness might speak ill of thee	140	10
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad	140	11
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be	140	12
That I may not be so nor thou belied	140	13
Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide	140	14
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes	141	1
For they in thee a thousand errors note	141	2
But tis my heart that loves what they despise	141	3
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote	141	4
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted	141	5
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone	141	6
Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited	141	7
To any sensual feast with thee alone	141	8
But my five wits nor my five senses can	141	9
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee	141	10
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man	141	11
Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be	141	12
Only my plague thus far I count my gain	141	13
That she that makes me sin awards me pain	141	14
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate	142	1
Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving	142	2
O but with mine compare thou thine own state	142	3
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving	142	4
Or if it do not from those lips of thine	142	5
That have profan'd their scarlet ornaments	142	6
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine	142	7
Robb'd others beds revenues of their rents	142	8
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those	142	9
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee	142	10
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows	142	11
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be	142	12
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide	142	13
By self-example mayst thou be denied	142	14
Lo as a careful housewife runs to catch	143	1
One of her feather'd creatures broke away	143	2
Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch	143	3
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay	143	4
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase	143	5
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent	143	6
To follow that which flies before her face	143	7
Not prizing her poor infant's discontent	143	8
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee	143	9
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind	143	10
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me	143	11
And play the mother's part kiss me be kind	143	12
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will	143	13
If thou turn back and my loud crying still	143	14
Two loves I have of comfort and despair	144	1
Which like two spirits do suggest me still	144	2
The better angel is a man right fair	144	3
The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill	144	4
To win me soon to hell my female evil	144	5
Tempteth my better angel from my side	144	6
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil	144	7
Wooing his purity with her foul pride	144	8
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend	144	9
Suspect I may yet not directly tell	144	10
But being both from me both to each friend	144	11
I guess one angel in another's hell	144	12
Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt	144	13
Till my bad angel fire my good one out	144	14
Those lips that Love's own hand did make	145	1
Breathed forth the sound that said I hate	145	2
To me that languish'd for her sake	145	3
But when she saw my woeful state	145	4
Straight in her heart did mercy come	145	5
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet	145	6
Was us'd in giving gentle doom	145	7
And taught it thus anew to greet	145	8
I hate she alter'd with an end	145	9
That followed it as gentle day	145	10
Doth follow night who like a fiend	145	11
From heaven to hell is flown away	145	12
I hate from hate away she threw	145	13
And sav'd my life saying not you	145	14
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth	146	1
My sinful earth these rebel powers array	146	2
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth	146	3
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay	146	4
Why so large cost having so short a lease	146	5
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend	146	6
Shall worms inheritors of this excess	146	7
Eat up thy charge Is this thy body's end	146	8
Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss	146	9
And let that pine to aggravate thy store	146	10
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross	146	11
Within be fed without be rich no more	146	12
So shall thou feed on Death that feeds on men	146	13
And Death once dead there's no more dying then	146	14
My love is as a fever longing still	147	1
For that which longer nurseth the disease	147	2
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill	147	3
The uncertain sickly appetite to please	147	4
My reason the physician to my love	147	5
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept	147	6
Hath left me and I desperate now approve	147	7
Desire is death which physic did except	147	8
Past cure I am now Reason is past care	147	9
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest	147	10
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are	147	11
At random from the truth vainly express'd	147	12
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright	147	13
Who art as black as hell as dark as night	147	14
O me what eyes hath Love put in my head	148	1
Which have no correspondence with true sight	148	2
Or if they have where is my judgment fled	148	3
That censures falsely what they see aright	148	4
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote	148	5
What means the world to say it is not so	148	6
If it be not then love doth well denote	148	7
Love's eye is not so true as all men's no	148	8
How can it O how can Love's eye be true	148	9
That is so vexed with watching and with tears	148	10
No marvel then though I mistake my view	148	11
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears	148	12
O cunning Love with tears thou keep'st me blind	148	13
Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find	148	14
Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not	149	1
When I against myself with thee partake	149	2
Do I not think on thee when I forgot	149	3
Am of my self all tyrant for thy sake	149	4
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend	149	5
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon	149	6
Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend	149	7
Revenge upon myself with present moan	149	8
What merit do I in my self respect	149	9
That is so proud thy service to despise	149	10
When all my best doth worship thy defect	149	11
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes	149	12
But love hate on for now I know thy mind	149	13
Those that can see thou lov'st and I am blind	149	14
O from what power hast thou this powerful might	150	1
With insufficiency my heart to sway	150	2
To make me give the lie to my true sight	150	3
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day	150	4
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill	150	5
That in the very refuse of thy deeds	150	6
There is such strength and warrantise of skill	150	7
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds	150	8
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more	150	9
The more I hear and see just cause of hate	150	10
O though I love what others do abhor	150	11
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state	150	12
If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me	150	13
More worthy I to be belov'd of thee	150	14
Love is too young to know what conscience is	151	1
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love	151	2
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss	151	3
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove	151	4
For thou betraying me I do betray	151	5
My nobler part to my gross body's treason	151	6
My soul doth tell my body that he may	151	7
Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason	151	8
But rising at thy name doth point out thee	151	9
As his triumphant prize Proud of this pride	151	10
He is contented thy poor drudge to be	151	11
To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side	151	12
No want of conscience hold it that I call	151	13
Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall	151	14
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn	152	1
But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing	152	2
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn	152	3
In vowing new hate after new love bearing	152	4
But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee	152	5
When I break twenty I am perjur'd most	152	6
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee	152	7
And all my honest faith in thee is lost	152	8
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness	152	9
Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy	152	10
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness	152	11
Or made them swear against the thing they see	152	12
For I have sworn thee fair more perjur'd I	152	13
To swear against the truth so foul a lie	152	14
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep	153	1
A maid of Dian's this advantage found	153	2
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep	153	3
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground	153	4
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love	153	5
A dateless lively heat still to endure	153	6
And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove	153	7
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure	153	8
But at my mistress eye Love's brand new-fired	153	9
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast	153	10
I sick withal the help of bath desired	153	11
And thither hied a sad distemper'd guest	153	12
But found no cure the bath for my help lies	153	13
Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eyes	153	14
The little Love-god lying once asleep	154	1
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand	154	2
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep	154	3
Came tripping by but in her maiden hand	154	4
The fairest votary took up that fire	154	5
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd	154	6
And so the general of hot desire	154	7
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd	154	8
This brand she quenched in a cool well by	154	9
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual	154	10
Growing a bath and healthful remedy	154	11
For men diseas'd but I my mistress thrall	154	12
Came there for cure and this by that I prove	154	13
Love's fire heats water water cools not love	154	14
