# Xandly5

Xandly5 is a lyric generator powered by Natural Language Processing using the Keras and TensorFlow frameworks.  A Deep Learning model is trained on separate collections of works to produce genre-specific output.

This project should *not* be seen as an attempt to replace creative artists.  This would be impossible and, more importantly, unwanted.  Xandly5 is an experimental tool to empower individuals by providing a springboard for ideas.
